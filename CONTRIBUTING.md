Thanks for building with Trustless Work 👋

## Branch & PR Rules

- Do **not** push directly to `main`.
- All changes must be proposed via a **Pull Request**.
- Create a branch named after your change, e.g.:
  - `feat/escrow-lifecycle-diagram`
  - `fix/api-error-handling`
- Keep PRs focused and small whenever possible.

## Steps

1. Fork the repo (if you’re external) or create a new branch (if you’re in the org).
2. Create your branch from `main`.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Open a Pull Request into `main`.
5. Wait for review and address feedback.
